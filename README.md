# java-emailer

NOTE: This repo is a demonstration of how to use the JavaMail API with Google's SMTP server to send simple emails from your code. This is not the most secure way to send emails, so please use caution with how you use this code and what sensitive data you choose to share. This Java program was built with IntelliJ IDEA.

In order to send test emails to yourself, your email account needs to have access to less secure apps and have 2-step verification turned off. Please read Google Support for more information regarding using less secure apps: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?authuser=2
